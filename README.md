## Description

The era of submitting paper job applications by the applicants, and publishing job listings by the employers had gone. The modern job listings require an employer to digitally list their vacant positions and job descriptions over the Internet or on their Websites. These job openings are normally promoted on the Job Boards by the prospective employers seeking to find qualified candidates with the required Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities that match or commensurate with the job requirements and job descriptions.

The project's primary focus is to "build a collaborative full-stack application that oombine a robust back end -with servers, databases, advanced APIs, and user authentication—to an intuitive front end", where employers can publish their job listings and job openings. This site is built from scratch and deployed to Heroku. The project follows the requirements below:

- Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.

- Use Handlebars.js as the template engine.

- Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.

- Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.

- Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we haven’t discussed.

- Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.

- Include authentication (express-session and cookies).

- Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.

- Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

- Have a polished UI.

- Be responsive.

- Be interactive (in other words, accept and respond to user input).

- Meet good-quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, and so on).

- Have a professional README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

## Getting Started

Your application’s folder structure must follow the Model-View-Controller paradigm. You’ll need to use the [express-handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars) package to implement Handlebars.js for your Views, use the [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) and [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) packages to connect to a MySQL database for your Models, and create an Express.js API for your Controllers.

You’ll also need the [dotenv package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) to use environment variables, the [bcrypt package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) to hash passwords, and the [express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session) and [connect-session-sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect-session-sequelize) packages to add authentication.
