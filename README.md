## Description

The era of submitting paper job applications by the applicants, and publishing job listings in the print media by the employers had gone. The modern job listings require an employer to digitally list their vacant positions and job descriptions over the Internet or on their Websites. These job openings are normally promoted on the Job Boards by the prospective employers seeking to find qualified candidates with the required Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities that match or commensurate with the job requirements and job descriptions.

The project's primary focus is to "build a collaborative full-stack application that oombine a robust back end -with servers, databases, advanced APIs, and user authentication—to an intuitive front end", where employers can publish their job listings and job openings. This site is built from scratch and deployed to Heroku. The project follows the requirements below:

## Motivation for the Project

The importance of the Job Board and Job Listings in the information technology industry and the job market in general cannot be over-emphasized. The project team was encouraged to create a job board that is similar to the traditional and popular job boards like Indeed, Dice, Monster, Career Builder, etc.

We plan to collaborate and expand the job board project at the end of the Boot Camp. Hopefully, we can also use it to search for jobs in the future. 

## User Story

I WANT a Job Board
SO THAT I can publish job openings, with the required attributes like job titles, job descriptions, job ids, and job locations.
